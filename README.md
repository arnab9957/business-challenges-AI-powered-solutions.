# SME Insights Navigator

This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio that provides AI-powered business solutions for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).

## Project Overview

The **SME Insights Navigator** is a sophisticated web application designed to act as an AI-powered business consultant for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It provides users with tailored, innovative, and data-driven solutions to their most pressing business challenges.

### 1. **User-Centric Input Form**

The application starts with a comprehensive, multi-step form that gathers crucial information about the user's business:

- **Industry:** A dropdown menu allows users to select their specific industry (e.g., Technology, Retail, Healthcare).
- **Business Context:** An optional textarea for users to provide background information about their company, its mission, and its customers.
- **Common Problems:** A searchable list of common business challenges (e.g., "Low Sales," "Ineffective Marketing") that users can select.
- **Main Challenge:** A dedicated textarea for users to describe their primary challenge in their own words, allowing for a highly personalized analysis.
- **Live Preview:** A sidebar component provides real-time feedback and summarizes the user's input as they fill out the form, enhancing usability.

### 2. **AI-Powered Solution Generation**

At the heart of the application is a powerful Genkit AI flow that processes the user's input to generate a detailed action plan. This flow is not just a simple prompt; it's a multi-faceted agent that:

- **Uses Tools for Context:** It calls an AI tool (`getContextualData`) to fetch simulated, real-time market trends and economic data relevant to the user's industry.
- **Learns from Feedback:** The system incorporates a "learning from peers" simulation. It analyzes a history of previously submitted solutions that were marked as "helpful" or "not helpful" to generate new strategies with a higher probability of success.
- **Generates Structured Output:** The AI is prompted to return a detailed JSON object containing solutions, KPIs, impact analysis data, and a data narrative.

### 3. **Interactive & Data-Rich Results Dashboard**

Once the AI has generated its response, the application presents the findings in a rich, interactive dashboard with two main tabs:

- **Overview Tab:**
    - **Recommended Solutions:** Displays the generated solutions in an accordion format, where each solution details the implementation cost, time-to-value, required resources, and a step-by-step strategic blueprint.
    - **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Lists the custom KPIs suggested by the AI to track the success of the proposed solutions.
- **Detailed Analysis Tab:**
    - **Predictive Impact Modeling:** A vertical bar chart visualizes the projected impact (0-100 scale) and confidence interval (worst-case vs. best-case) for each solution. Users can click on a bar to interact with the chart below.
    - **Stakeholder Value Distribution:** A dynamic donut chart shows how the value generated by the selected solution is distributed among key stakeholders: Customers, Business, Employees, and the Community.
    - **Data Narrative:** A compelling, AI-generated story explains the "why" behind the data, making complex projections easy to understand.

### 4. **Conversational AI Chat**

To make the experience even more interactive, the results page includes a "Follow-up Question" section. This is a fully functional chat interface where users can ask the AI questions about the generated solutions, KPIs, or impact analysis. The AI uses the context of the original solution and the conversation history to provide relevant, helpful answers.

### 5. **Robust Technology Stack**

The project is built on a modern and powerful tech stack:

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router) and [React](https://react.dev/).
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for a professional and consistent design system.
- **AI/Generative Logic:** [Google's Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) orchestrates the AI flows, tool use, and interaction with the Gemini family of models.
- **Forms & Validation:** [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for robust and type-safe form management.
- **Data Visualization:** [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for creating beautiful and interactive charts.
- **Environment Management:** [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to securely manage API keys.

## Getting Started

To get started with local development, first install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you will need to run two separate commands in two separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Run the Next.js Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2: Run the Genkit Development Server**

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. The Genkit server runs on a different port and is used by the Next.js app to make AI requests.
