## Getting Started

To get started with local development, first install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you will need to run two separate commands in two separate terminals.

**Terminal 1: Run the Next.js Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2: Run the Genkit Development Server**
```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. The Genkit server runs on a different port and is used by the Next.js app to make AI requests.
